Created an application in Java. 

This applicaiton is to manage Employee details according to their respective Designations in a data file. 
Using Data Structues and collection classes for maintaining the DS to respond quickly.
This application has more then CRUD features. 
I have used Gradle build tool for compilation.

To test it out, do git pull and run testcases. by providing the appropriate classpath 

c:\JavaApp\hr

java -classpath c:\JavaApp

use "gradle build" to compile in bl folder inside hr.

hr/bl>gradle build[ENTER]
